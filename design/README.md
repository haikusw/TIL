> * At small sizes, san-serif works better for body text and regular copy, while serif is appropriate for paragraph headers. Again, size dictates this guideline, as headers tend to be larger and bolder.
> * At standard and larger sizes, serif can be for body text, and may actually work better as the font is more legible and causes less eye strain or fatigue than sans-serif–especially when used to display longer, expansive passages.
> * Assign and stay consistent when using the two fonts in tandem. For example, the title of a passage may use serif, while immediately beneath it is the author’s name in a smaller san-serif font. Be sure to follow the assignment precedent throughout your site, so as to avoid confusion for your viewers.
> * When choosing serif and sans-serif fonts to be used together, avoid combinations that vary too much in look and feel. For example, pairing an overly-heavy serif font with an extremely light sans-serif font will create discord and visual imbalance in the viewing experience.
