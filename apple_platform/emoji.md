# Emoji

#### [Emoji 4.0](https://oleb.net/blog/2016/12/emoji-4-0/)

> You’ve probably seen that the just-released iOS 10.2 and macOS 10.12.2 include dozens of new emoji. There’s more to this than just a bunch of new symbols, however.

#### [It’s not wrong that "🤦🏼‍♂️".length == 7](https://hsivonen.fi/string-length/)

> From time to time, someone shows that in JavaScript the .length of a string containing an emoji results in a number greater than 1 (typically 2) and then proceeds to the conclusion that haha JavaScript is so broken—and is rewarded with many likes. In this post, I will try to convince you that ridiculing JavaScript for this is less insightful than it first appears and that Swift’s approach to string length isn’t unambiguously the best one. Python 3’s approach is unambiguously the worst one, though.
