## How To

#### [How SwiftUI can now be used to build entire iOS apps](https://wwdcbysundell.com/2020/building-entire-apps-with-swiftui/)

> This year, however, entire apps can now be defined directly using SwiftUI, thanks to a few new additions to its API.

#### [What’s new in SwiftUI for iOS 14](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/221/whats-new-in-swiftui-for-ios-14)

> SwiftUI was inevitably going to see big changes this year, and I’m really excited to experiment with them all – text views, color pickers, progress views, and even limited support for grids have all landed. 

#### [How to define SwiftUI properties](https://twitter.com/chriseidhof/status/1280433133813456896)

> Here's a first draft of a decision tree for how to define your SwiftUI properties...

#### [A guide to SwiftUI’s state management system](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/articles/swiftui-state-management-guide/)

> What separates SwiftUI from Apple’s previous UI frameworks isn’t just how views and other UI components are defined, but also how view-level state is managed throughout an app that uses it.
> 
>  [...]
> 
> This week, let’s take a closer look at each of those property wrappers, how they relate to each other, and how they make up different parts of SwiftUI’s overall state management system. 

#### [Mastering toolbars in SwiftUI](https://swiftwithmajid.com/2020/07/15/mastering-toolbars-in-swiftui/)

> This week we will learn all about the new Toolbar API.

#### [Setting up a multi-platform SwiftUI project](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2021/03/04/Multiplatform-SwiftUI.html)

> This blog will take a look at a basic setup for a multi-platform SwiftUI app.

#### [MatchedGeometryEffect | The SwiftUI Lab](https://swiftui-lab.com/matchedgeometryeffect-part1/)

> We are talking about a new extension to the View protocol, the .matchedGeometryEffect() modifier. On its own, it’s good enough, but in combination with other techniques we learned already (custom transitions and animatable modifiers), it becomes even better. It is an essential skill to put in your SwiftUI toolkit.

#### [Generating automatic placeholders for SwiftUI views](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/tips/swiftui-automatic-placeholders/)

> SwiftUI now ships with a new, built-in modifier that makes it really easy to automatically generate a placeholder for any view. 

#### [Creating custom `.redacted` effects](https://fivestars.blog/code/redacted-custom-effects.html)

> With the recent release of Xcode 12 we’ve gained a new `.redacted(reason:)` SwiftUI modifier.

#### [Impossible Grids with SwiftUI](https://swiftui-lab.com/impossible-grids/)

> Native support for grids in SwiftUI is finally here. This is made possible by two new views. These are LazyVGrid and LazyHGrid.

#### [Fetching objects from Core Data in a SwiftUI project](https://www.donnywals.com/fetching-objects-from-core-data-in-a-swiftui-project/)

> When you've added Core Data to your SwiftUI project and you have some data stored in your database, the next hurdle is to somehow fetch that data from your Core Data store and present it to the user.

#### [Sharing layout information in SwiftUI](https://fivestars.blog/swiftui/swiftui-share-layout-information.html)

> SwiftUI views layout depends on each view state. This state is composed of a mix of internal properties, external values coming from the environment, etc.
