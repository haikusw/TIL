# iOS Testing

#### [iOS Snapshot Testing](https://www.pointfree.co/blog/posts/23-snapshottesting-1-0-delightful-swift-snapshot-testing)

> The iOS community has been a large proponent of snapshot testing, mostly thanks to the wonderful iOSSnapshotTestCase library (formerly known as FBSnapshotTestCase). It introduced a new kind of test coverage for iOS applications by allowing us to assert against an image screenshot of a UI component. This is a whole new level of testing that can catch regressions in the pixel data of our UI so that you can make sure that future changes and refactors do not introduce visual regressions into your views.
